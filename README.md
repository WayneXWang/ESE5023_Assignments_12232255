1st assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "99" for this assignment, including "-3" for occasional obscure remarks especially in Problem 3 and 5 and "+2" for the well-organized logical flow. BTW, please print the question result exactly below the question next time and there is no need to write so many functions. Keep going!
