## 1st assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "99" for this assignment, including "-3" for occasional obscure remarks especially in Problem 3 and 5 and "+2" for the well-organized logical flow. BTW, please print the question result exactly below the question next time and there is no need to write so many functions. Keep going!

## 2nd assignment review - chenyy
Good job for the first assignment! I shall give you "89" for this assignment, including "+2" for your detailed comments in script, "-3" own to reversing lon and lat in Q3.4 and "-10" for you may misunderstand the aims of questions in Q3.8, Q3.9, and Q3.10.
Hint: for Q3.8 `Climatology` of `dayofyear` means to calculate the average of all years for each of the sequential day, and in Q3.9: `Anomally` means using data of each day of each year minus the average of the sequantial day we calculated on Q3.8
